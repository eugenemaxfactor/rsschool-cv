### Briefly About Myself:

I am a web developer with 4 years of experience in no-code development, using platforms like Bubble and Webflow. I specialize in creating CRM systems. Currently, I am looking to deepen my knowledge by studying fundamental web development concepts and programming. My strengths include attention to detail, the ability to quickly learn new things, and a commitment to continuous improvement. Despite the lack of commercial experience in traditional programming, I actively work on personal projects and strive to apply the knowledge I have gained in practice.
